<h2>8 effective ways to do social media marketing for restaurants</h2>
<ol>
<h3>
<li>Setup a complete social media profile</li>
</h3>
<p>The first step towards productive social media marketing for a restaurant is to create a profile on the platforms available. Currently, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and Pinterest form the core of any social media marketing strategy. This will give your restaurant a good enough visibility to your targeted audience. </p>
<p>And don’t just create the profile for the sake of doing it. Add each and every information that’s required, and set up the complete profile. Be active through that profile and gradually you’ll see how your restaurant reaches your audience. </p>
<h3>
<li>Be trendy in terms of content</li>
</h3>
<p>Social media is all about engaging with your audience, reaching to them right where they are. So, you need to be impressive with whatever content you create and post on the social media. </p>
<p>Either you can display your culinary expertise, put up drooling pictures of the decadent dishes you create, share selfies with guests and staff, offer attractive discounts, and even show how your restaurant’s ambiance is .. well you can do lots of things! </p>
<p>If you’ve got a proper recipe management system, you can even post recipes for your dishes to fascinate your guests. </p>
<h3>
<li>Your guests are the best marketing medium</li>
</h3>
<p>Because you’re interacting with your guests at a personal level, you can certainly ask them to rate and review you on your social media profiles. This will help you reach wider audiences and even be preferred by many. </p>
<blockquote><p>80 % of social media users said that they’re more likely to try new things based on what their friends suggest.</p></blockquote>
<p>More than that, there are high chances that they’ll check-in at your restaurant on Facebook or so, even post pics while dining at your restaurant. This will appear when anyone searches for your restaurant on social media. </p>
<h3>
<li>Do some audience building</li>
</h3>
<p>Adding guests as your friends or followers, and being active in one way or the other can be very fruitful. The more friends and groups you are connected to, the more recommended you’ll become on social media. </p>
<p>You can even set up loyalty programs at your restaurant for your guests, which will make them visit again on a regular basis. </p>
<h3>
<li>Try connecting with online food apps</li>
</h3>
<p>You should consider partnering or signing up with online food apps viz. Zomato, Swiggy, Yelp, Foursquare and such likes to do social media marketing for restaurants. </p>
<p>These food apps will increase your visibility and bring in more customers. Not only that but if you’re open to home delivery and takeaway options, then these apps will work to get orders for you. </p>
<h3>
<li>Use short videos for your restaurant’s branding</li>
</h3>
<p>Short videos are game changers. You can very effectively communicate with your audience by posting such videos, like the chef preparing a dish, how a day at your restaurant looks like or a 360-degree view of your restaurant.</p>
<p>These kinds of messages get easily viral. Even a video of your customers savoring your dishes can help in social media marketing for restaurants. </p>
<h3>
<li>Manage your reviews on social media</li>
</h3>
<p>You need to be active on these social media platforms. If not anything, you need to be agile with the reviews you get there. Positive feedback is definitely good, but you need to keep an eye on the negative feedbacks. Even a single negative review can nosedive your rankings, if not handled wisely. </p>
<p>So, keeping eye on such kind of activities is a very critical part of social media marketing for restaurants. </p>
<h3>
<li>Run paid advertising campaigns</li>
</h3>
<p>You can run paid ad campaigns on social media. Ads are much cheaper on Facebook and you can easily get more likes by running the ads in less advertising investment. Even if you spend $1 per day, you get across more than 4,000 people. So, if none of your competitors is investing in social media, then this time you’ve got to gain an edge over them.
