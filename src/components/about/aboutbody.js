                                   At Foodcham, our primary goal is to bring a change in the food ordering system of a restaurant and bringing the immense customer experience to the very niche of the food Industry,
                                   i.e fine dining restaurants by replacing the already running Physical Menus. Since digitization is a reflection of the future, pushing the Menu and orders of a restaurant online 
                                   fetches scope and room for a lot of analysis and improvement in the user experience. The primary goal being giving the users and customers a users an ease and command over the digital system.
