    <p>
        The Website is brought to you by Igniter Labs Ltd. Igniter Labs Ltd believes it is important to protect your Personal Data
        (as defined in the Data Protection Act 1998) and we are committed to giving you a personalised service that meets your needs
        in a way that also protects your privacy. This policy explains how we may collect Personal Data about you. It also explains some
        of the security measures we take to protect your Personal Data, and tells you certain things we will do and not do.
        You should read this policy in conjunction with the Website Terms.
    </p>

    <p>
        When we first obtain Personal Data from you, or when you take a new service or product from us, we will give you the
        opportunity to tell us if you do or do not want to receive information from us about other services or products (as applicable).
        You can normally do this by ticking a box on an application form or contract. You may change your mind at any time by emailing us
        at the address below.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some of the Personal Data we hold about you may be 'sensitive personal data' within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998,
        for example, information about your health or ethnic origin.
    </p>
    <h4 id="collecting-information"><strong>1. Collecting Information</strong></h4>
    <p>
        We may collect Personal Data about you from a number of sources, including the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>From you when you agree to take a service or product from us, in which case this may include your contact details,
            date of birth, how you will pay for the product or service and your bank details.</li>
        <li>From you when you contact us with an enquiry or in response to a communication from us, in which case, this may
            tell us something about how you use our services.</li>
        <li>From documents that are available to the public, such as the electoral register.</li>
        <li>From third parties to whom you have provided information with your consent to pass it on to other organisations or persons.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="personal-information"><strong>2. Using Your Personal Information</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal Data about our customers is an important part of our business and we shall only use your Personal Data for the following
            purposes and shall not keep such Personal Data longer than is necessary to fulfil these purposes:
            <ul>
                <li>To help us to identify you when you contact us.</li>
                <li>To help us to identify accounts, services and/or products which you could have from us or selected partners from time to time.
                    We may do this by automatic means using a scoring system, which uses the Personal Data you have provided and/or any information
                    we hold about you and Personal Data from third party agencies (including credit reference agencies).</li>
                <li>To help us to administer and to contact you about improved administration of any accounts, services and products we have
                    provided before, do provide now or will or may provide in the future.</li>
                <li>To allow us to carry out marketing analysis and customer profiling (including with transactional information), conduct research,
                    including creating statistical and testing information.</li>
                <li>To help to prevent and detect fraud or loss.</li>
                <li>To allow us to contact you in any way (including mail, email, telephone, visit, text or multimedia messages) about products and
                    services offered by us where
                    <ul>
                        <li>these products are similar to those you have already purchased from us,</li>
                        <li>you were given the opportunity to opt out of being contacted by us at the time your Personal Information was originally
                            collected by us and at the time of our subsequent communications with you, and</li>
                        <li>you have not opted out of us contacting you.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>To allow us to contact you in any way (including mail, email, telephone, visit, text or multimedia messages) about products and
                    services offered by us and selected partners where you have expressly consented to us doing so.</li>
                <li>We may monitor and record communications with you (including phone conversations and emails) for quality assurance and compliance.</li>
                <li>We may check your details with fraud prevention agencies. If you provide false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud,
                    we will record this.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We will not disclose your Personal Data to any third party except in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li>We may allow other people and organisations to use Personal Data we hold about you in the following circumstances:
            <ul>
                <li>If we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired or are in the process of being acquired by a third party, in which case
                    Personal Data held by us, about our customers, will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
                <li>If we have been legitimately asked to provide information for legal or regulatory purposes or as part of legal proceedings or
                    prospective legal proceedings.</li>
                <li>We employ companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf and we may disclose your Personal Data to these parties
                    for the purposes set out in clause 2.1 or, for example, for fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email,
                    removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and
                    links (including paid listings and links) and providing customer service. Those parties are bound by strict contractual provisions
                    with us and only have access to Personal Data needed to perform their functions, and may not use it for other purposes. Further,
                    they must process the Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted by the Data Protection Act 1998.
                    From time to time, these other people and organisations to whom we may pass your Personal Data may be outside the European
                    Economic Area. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Personal Data is treated securely and in
                    accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Data Protection Act 1998.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Where you give us Personal Data on behalf of someone else, you confirm that you have provided them with the information set out in this
            Privacy Policy and that they have not objected to such use of their Personal Data.</li>
        <li>In connection with any transaction which we enter into with you:
            <ul>
                <li>We may carry out with one or more licensed credit reference and fraud prevention agencies:
                    <ul>
                        <li>credit checks where you have given us your express consent, and</li>
                        <li>fraud prevention checks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>We and they may keep a record of the search. Information held about you by these agencies may be linked to records relating
                    to other people living at the same address with whom you are financially linked. These records will also be taken into
                    account in credit and fraud prevention checks. Information from your application and payment details of your account
                    will be recorded with one or more of these agencies and may be shared with other organisations to help make credit and
                    insurance decisions about you and members of your household with whom you are financially linked and for debt collection and
                    fraud prevention. This includes those who have moved house and who have missed payments.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>If you provide false or inaccurate information to us and we suspect fraud, we will record this and may share it with other people and
            organisations. We, and other credit and insurance organisations, may also use technology to detect and prevent fraud.</li>
        <li>If you need details of those credit agencies and fraud prevention agencies from which we obtain and with which we record information
            about you, please write to our Data Protection Manager at Igniter Labs Ltd, 71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London United Kingdom,
            WC2H 9JQ.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="protecting-information"><strong>3. Protecting Information</strong></h4>
    We have strict security measures to protect Personal Data.
    <ul>
        <li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts
            information you input.</li>
        <li>We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card
            number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.</li>
        <li>We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personally
            identifiable customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose
            personal information to you.</li>
        <li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you
            finish using a shared computer.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="the-internet"><strong>4. The internet</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>If you communicate with us using the internet, we may occasionally email you about our services and products. When you first give us Personal Data through the Website, we will normally give you the opportunity to say whether you would prefer us not to contact you by email. You can also always send us an email (at the address set out below) at any time if you change your mind.</li>
        <li>Please remember that communications over the internet, such as emails and webmails (messages sent through a website), are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may go through a number of countries before they are delivered - this is the nature of the internet. We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of Personal Data that is beyond our control.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="cookies"><strong>5. Cookies</strong></h4>
    <p>
        When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. This sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your computer. These are called 'cookies'.
    </p>
    <p>These cookies cannot be used to identify you personally and are used to improve services for you, for example through:</p>

    <p>
        - Letting you navigate between pages efficiently<br />
        - Enabling a service to recognise your computer so you don't have to give the same information during one task<br />
        - Recognising that you have already given a username and password so you don't need to enter it for every web page requested<br />
        - Measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and that there is enough capacity to ensure they are fast
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
        Users typically have the opportunity to set their browser to accept all or some cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to
        receive cookies at any time. The last of these options, of course, means that personalised services cannot be provided and the user may
        not be able to take full advantage of all of a website's features. Refer to your browser's Help section for specific guidance on how
        it allows you to manage cookies and how you may delete cookies you wish to remove from your computer.
    </p>

    <p>Multiple cookies may be found in a single file depending on which browser you use.</p>

    <p>The cookies used on this website have been categorised based on the categories found in the ICC UK Cookie guide, as follows:</p>

    <p><strong>Category 1: strictly necessary cookies</strong></p>

    <p>
        These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of
        the website. Without these cookies services you have asked for, like shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Category 2: performance cookies</strong></p>

    <p>
        These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get
        error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect
        is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a website works.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Category 3: functionality cookies</strong></p>

    <p>
        These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide
        enhanced, more personal features. For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing
        in a cookie the region in which you are currently located. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size,
        fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as a live chat
        session. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Category 4: targeting cookies or advertising cookies</strong></p>

    <p>
        These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an
        advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with
        the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations
        such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.
